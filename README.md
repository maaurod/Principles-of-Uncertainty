# Principles of Uncertainty – Exercise Solutions

This repository contains solutions to selected exercises from the course  
[**Principles of Uncertainty**](https://fri-datascience.github.io/course_pou/index.html).

## Description

The (theory) solved exercises are mostly those I found to be the most **complex**, **difficult**, and **challenging**.  
By formalizing and writing out the solutions, the underlying concepts become clearer and easier to understand.
The R exercises are the ones used for practicing and understanding deeply the language.

## Contents

- Selected exercises from the *Principles of Uncertainty* handbook  
- Detailed, step-by-step solutions  
- Focus on conceptual understanding and formal reasoning.
- Exercises in R, first attempted on my own; if not solved, copied and commented for understanding based on the teacher’s solution.

## Exercises

Chapter 1 - Probability Spaces: 1.4, 1.11, 1.15.

Chapter 2 - Uncountable Probability Spaces: 2.4, 2.5 and Proposition 2.4.1 of theory.

Chapter 6 - Integration: 6.2.

R Exercises - 1.9, 1.10, 2.8, all from chapter 3.
