# Principles of Uncertainty – Exercise Solutions

This repository contains solutions to selected exercises from the course  
[**Principles of Uncertainty**](https://fri-datascience.github.io/course_pou/index.html).

## Description

The solved exercises are mostly those I found to be the most **complex**, **difficult**, and **challenging**.  
By formalizing and writing out the solutions, the underlying concepts become clearer and easier to understand.
